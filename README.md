# Network Alarm Prediction System

[![Theme](https://img.shields.io/badge/Theme-AI/ML%20%7C%20Open%20Innovation-blueviolet)](https://shields.io/)

An intelligent system to predict the next network alarm based on historical and current alarm data from large-scale optical communication networks. This project shifts from a reactive to a proactive approach in handling network faults, aiming to reduce hardware failures, improve SLA compliance, and maximize network uptime.

## üöÄ Overview

In large-scale optical communication networks, alarms are critical indicators of faults or anomalies. Handling these reactively leads to service disruptions and increased maintenance costs. This project introduces a predictive system that analyzes historical alarm data to forecast future alarms, identify patterns, and suggest preventive actions. By anticipating potential failures, such as a site failing due to heat-related issues, we can transform network maintenance from a reactive to a proactive, game-changing strategy.
